Markov Babbler 
-> need to make a method to add next character based on the probablity of its occurence on the refrence text
-> way to store the hash maps etc in a file so that i dont need to read same file again and again (done stored maps as json)
-> need to modify main so that it just needs to read the above json file ( this should make it faster than the current impleemntation)
-> add more refrence text
